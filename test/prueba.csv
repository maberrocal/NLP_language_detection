¿Sería apropiado que usted, Señora Presidenta, escribiese una carta al Presidente de Sri Lanka expresando las condolencias del Parlamento por esa y otras muertes violentas, pidiéndole que haga todo lo posible para encontrar una reconciliación pacífica ante la extremadamente difícil situación que está viviendo su país?|Spanish
Sí, señor Evans, pienso que una iniciativa como la que usted acaba de sugerir sería muy adecuada.|Spanish
Si la Asamblea está de acuerdo, haré lo que el señor Evans acaba de sugerir.|Spanish
Señora Presidenta, una cuestión de procedimiento.|Spanish
Me gustaría que me asesorara sobre el Artículo 143 concerniente a la inadmisibilidad.|Spanish
Mi pregunta se refiere a un asunto del que se hablará el jueves, día que en volveré a plantearla.|Spanish
El informe Cunha sobre los programas de dirección plurianual se presenta al Parlamento el jueves y contiene una propuesta en el apartado 6 en torno a una forma de penalizaciones basada en cuotas que debe aplicarse a los países que no cumplan anualmente sus objetivos de reducción de flota.|Spanish
El informe estipula que se debe aplicarse a pesar del principio de estabilidad relativa.|Spanish
Creo que el principio de estabilidad relativa es un principio legal fundamental de las políticas pesqueras comunitarias, por lo que una propuesta que lo subvierta es legalmente inadmisible.|Spanish
Quiero saber si se puede hacer este tipo de objeción a lo que sólo es un informe, no una propuesta legislativa, y si es algo que puedo plantear el jueves.|Spanish
Su Señoría, si así lo desea, podrá plantear esta cuestión en ese momento, es decir, el jueves antes de que se presente el informe.|Spanish
Señora Presidenta, coincidiendo con el primer período parcial de sesiones de este año del Parlamento Europeo, lamentablemente, en los Estados Unidos, en Texas, se ha fijado para el próximo jueves la ejecución de un condenado a la pena capital, un joven de 34 años que llamaremos con el nombre de Hicks.|Spanish
A petición de un diputado francés, el Sr. Zimeray, se ha presentado una solicitud, cuyos firmantes han sido numerosos y entre los cuales me cuento, sin embargo, de conformidad con la posición constantemente expresada por el Parlamento Europeo y por toda la Comunidad europea, le pido que intervenga con el prestigio de su cargo y de la Institución que representa ante el Presidente y el Gobernador del Estado de Texas, Sr. Bush, que tiene la facultad de suspender la condena a muerte y de indultar al condenado.|Spanish
Todo ello, de conformidad con los principios que siempre hemos apoyado.|Spanish
Gracias, señor Segni, lo haré de muy buen grado.|Spanish
Está, sin duda, dentro de la línea de las posiciones que nuestro Parlamento siempre ha adoptado.|Spanish
Señora Presidenta, quisiera llamar la atención de usted acerca de un caso del que se ha ocupado una y otra vez este Parlamento.|Spanish
Es el caso de Alexander Nikitin.|Spanish
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.|English
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.|English
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.|English
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.|English
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.|English
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.|English
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.|English
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.|English
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.|English
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.|English
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?|English
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?|English
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?|English
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?|English
Why are there no fire instructions?|English
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?|English
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced? It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.|English
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.|English
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.|English
Sì, onorevole Evans, ritengo che un' iniziativa del tipo che lei propone sia assolutamente opportuna.|Italian
Se l' Assemblea è d' accordo seguirò il suggerimento dell' onorevole Evans.|Italian
Signora Presidente, un richiamo al Regolamento.|Italian
Gradirei avere il suo parere riguardo all'articolo 143 sull'inammissibilità.|Italian
La mia domanda si ricollega a un tema all'ordine del giorno di giovedì e che formulerò di nuovo al momento opportuno.|Italian
La relazione Cunha sui programmi di orientamento pluriennali è iscritta all'ordine del giorno della Plenaria di giovedì e al paragrafo 6 contiene una proposta volta a introdurre una sorta di sanzione a carico delle quote di quei paesi che non riescono a raggiungere i loro obiettivi di riduzione annuali delle flotte, nonostante il principio della stabilità relativa.|Italian
Credo che tale principio sia un principio giuridico fondamentale della politica comune della pesca e qualsiasi proposta volta a sovvertirlo sarebbe giuridicamente inammissibile Vorrei sapere se è possibile sollevare un'obiezione di questo tipo nel contesto di una semplice relazione, e non di una proposta legislativa, e se rientra nelle mie competenze sollevare una tale obiezione giovedì prossimo.|Italian
E' appunto in quell' occasione che, se lo desidera, avrà modo di sollevare la sua questione pregiudiziale, cioè giovedì in apertura della discussione sulla relazione.|Italian
Il précise que cela devrait être fait malgré le principe de stabilité relative.|French
À mon sens, le principe de stabilité relative est un principe juridique fondamental de la politique commune de la pêche et toute proposition le bouleversant serait juridiquement irrecevable.|French
Je voudrais savoir si l'on peut avancer une objection de ce type à ce qui n'est qu'un rapport, pas une proposition législative, et si je suis habilité à le faire ce jeudi.|French
C'est exactement à ce moment-là que vous pourrez, en effet, si vous le souhaitez, soulever cette question, c'est-à-dire jeudi avant le début de la présentation du rapport.|French
Madame la Présidente, alors que se déroule la première session de l'année du Parlement européen, l'exécution d'un condamné à mort au Texas aux États-Unis, un jeune homme de 34 ans appelé Hicks, a été fixée, malheureusement, à jeudi prochain.|French
À la demande d'un député français, Monsieur Zimeray, une pétition a déjà été introduite ; elle a récolté de nombreuses signatures dont la mienne.|French
Cependant, je vous demande, conformément à l'orientation désormais constamment exprimée par le Parlement européen et toute la Communauté européenne, d'intervenir auprès du président et du gouverneur du Texas, Monsieur Bush, en faisant jouer le prestige de votre mandat et de l'Institution que vous représentez, car c'est Monsieur Bush qui a le pouvoir de suspendre la condamnation à mort et de gracier le condamné.|French
Et tout ceci dans le respect des principes que nous avons toujours soutenus.|French
Merci, Monsieur Segni, je le ferai bien volontiers.|French
C'est en effet tout à fait dans la ligne des positions que notre Parlement a toujours adoptées.|French
Madame la Présidente, je voudrais attirer votre attention sur un cas dont s'est régulièrement occupé le Parlement.|French
Il s'agit du cas d'Alexandre Nikitin.|French
Nous nous réjouissons tous, dans cette enceinte, que le tribunal ait prononcé sa libération et ait clairement établi qu'en Russie aussi, l'accès aux informations environnementales était un droit constitutionnel.|French
Cependant, il se fait qu'il semblerait être à nouveau mis en accusation, le ministère public ayant interjeté appel.|French
Nous savons, et nous l'avons d'ailleurs établi dans de très nombreuses résolutions - y compris lors de la dernière période de session de l'année dernière -, que ce cas n'est pas seulement de nature juridique et qu'il est faux d'accuser Alexandre Nikitin d'activité criminelle et de trahison car nous sommes concernés par ses résultats et nous en profitons.|French
Ces résultats forment la base des programmes européens de protection de la mer de Barents et c'est pourquoi je vous prie d'examiner un projet de lettre vous dépeignant les faits essentiels de cette affaire et de communiquer à la Russie la position qui découle des décisions du Parlement.|French
Oui, Madame Schroedter, j'examinerai bien volontiers les faits relatifs à cette question lorsque j'aurai reçu votre lettre.|French
Madame la Présidente, je voudrais tout d'abord vous féliciter pour avoir tenu parole car en effet, en cette première période de session, en cette nouvelle année, le nombre de chaînes de télévision a réellement été augmenté de manière significative dans nos locaux.|French
Toutefois, Madame la Présidente, ce que j'avais demandé n'a pas été réalisé.|French
Il y a bien deux chaînes finnoises et une chaîne portugaise, mais il n'y a toujours aucune chaîne néerlandaise. Pourtant je vous avais demandé une chaîne néerlandaise, car les Néerlandais aussi désirent pouvoir suivre les actualités chaque mois lorsqu'ils sont envoyés en cette terre d'exil.|French
Je vous demande donc à nouveau de faire le nécessaire pour que nous puissions disposer d'une chaîne néerlandaise.|French
Madame Plooij-van Gorsel, je peux vous dire que cette question est à l'ordre du jour de la réunion des questeurs de mercredi.|French
Elle sera, je l'espère, examinée dans un esprit positif.|French
Resumption of the session|English
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.|English
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.|English
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.|English
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.|English
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.|English
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)|English
Madam President, on a point of order.|English
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.|English
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.|English
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?|English
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.|English
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.|English
Madam President, on a point of order.|English
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.|English
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.|English
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.|English
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.|English
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.|English
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.|English
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.|English
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.|English
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself. However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.|English
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.|English
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.|English
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.|English
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.|English
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.|English
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.|English
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.|English
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.|English
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.|English
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.|English
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.|English
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.|English
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.|English
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.|English
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.|English
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.|English
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?|English
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?|English
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?|English
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?|English
Why are there no fire instructions?|English
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?|English
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?|English
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.|English
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.|English
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.|English
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.|English
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.|English
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.|English
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.|English
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.|English
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.|English
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.|English
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?|English
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.|English
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.|English
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.|English
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.|English
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.|English
We do not know what is happening.|English
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?|English
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.|English
Agenda|English
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.|English
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.|English
Relating to Wednesday:|English
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.|English
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.|English
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.|English
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.|English
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.|English
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.|English
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.|English
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.|English
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.|English
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.|English
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.|English
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.|English
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.|English
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.|English
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.|English
(Applause from the PSE Group)|English
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.|English
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.|English
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.|English
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.|English
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.|English
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.|English
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.|English
(Parliament rejected the request) President.|English
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.|English
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.|English
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?|English
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.|English
I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.|English
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.|English
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.|English
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.|English
Thank you, Mr Poettering.|English
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.|English
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic. He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.|English
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.|English
It is not a lot to ask.|English
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.|English
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.|English
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)|English
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.|English
Thank you very much.|English
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.|English
My vote was "in favour" .|English
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.|English
There is no room for amendments.|English
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.|English
That did not happen.|English
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.|English
This is an important matter.|English
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.|English
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.|English
You did not call me either.|English
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.|English
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.|English
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.|English
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.|English
This seems to me to be a workable solution.|English
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.|English
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.|English
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?|English
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.|English
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.|English
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods|English
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).|English
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.|English
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.|English
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.|English
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.|English
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.|English
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.|English
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.|English
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.|English
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.|English
I would urge you to endorse this.|English
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.|English
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.|English
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.|English
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.|English
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.|English
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.|English
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.|English
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.|English
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.|English
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.|English
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.|English
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.|English
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.|English
I congratulate him on his excellent report.|English
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.|English
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.|English
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.|English
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.|English
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.|English
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.|English
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.|English
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.|English
This is a pity, in a sense.|English
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.|English
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.|English
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.|English
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.|English
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.|English
In short, the issue is an important one.|English
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.|English
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.|English
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.|English
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.|English
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.|English
I would like to mention one final point.|English
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.|English
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.|English
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.|English
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.|English
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.|English
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.|English
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.|English
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.|English
This, however, does not seem feasible.|English
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.|English
I should like to make just a few comments.|English
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.|English
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.|English
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.|English
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.|English
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.|English
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.|English
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.|English
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.|English
My third point has also been mentioned already. As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.|English
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.|English
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.|English
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.|English
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.|English
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.|English
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.|English
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.|English
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.|English
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.|English
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.|English
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.|English
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.|English
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.|English
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.|English
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.|English
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.|English
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
Transport of dangerous goods by road|English
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].|English
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.|English
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.|English
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.|English
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.|English
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.|English
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.|English
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.|English
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.|English
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.|English
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own.|English
In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.|English
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.|English
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.|English
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.|English
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.|English
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.|English
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC.|English
This is in the special interest of northern European regions.|English
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.|English
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.|English
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.|English
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.|English
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.|English
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.|English
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.|English
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.|English
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.|English
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.|English
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.|English
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.|English
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.|English
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.|English
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.|English
I thought that it was quite superb.|English
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.|English
This directive is a contribution to this.|English
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.|English
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.|English
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.|English
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.|English
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.|English
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.|English
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.|English
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.|English
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.|English
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.|English
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.|English
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.|English
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.|English
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.|English
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.|English
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.|English
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.|English
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.|English
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.|English
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.|English
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.|English
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.|English
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.|English
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?|English
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.|English
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.|English
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.|English
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.|English
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.|English
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.|English
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.|English
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.|English
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination|English
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].|English
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.|English
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.|English
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.|English
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.|English
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.|English
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.|English
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government.|English
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.|English
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.|English
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.|English
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.|English
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.|English
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.|English
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.|English
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.|English
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.|English
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.|English
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.|English
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.|English
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.|English
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.|English
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.|English
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.|English
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.|English
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.|English
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.|English
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.|English
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.|English
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.|English
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.|English
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.|English
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.|English
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.|English
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.|English
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.|English
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.|English
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.|English
The consequences do not inspire hope.|English
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.|English
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.|English
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.|English
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.|English
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.|English
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.|English
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.|English
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.|English
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.|English
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.|English
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.|English
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.|English
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.|English
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.|English
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.|English
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.|English
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.|English
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.|English
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.|English
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status. It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.|English
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.|English
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality. I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.|English
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.|English
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.|English
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.|English
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.|English
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.|English
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.|English
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.|English
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.|English
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.|English
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.|English
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.|English
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.|English
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.|English
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.|English
We are badly behind now in this matter.|English
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.|English
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.|English
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.|English
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.|English
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.|English
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.|English
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.|English
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.|English
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.|English
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.|English
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.|English
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.|English
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.|English
This report is very good and our Group supports it.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.|English
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today. This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.|English
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.|English
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.|English
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.|English
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.|English
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.|English
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.|English
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.|English
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.|English
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.|English
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.|English
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.|English
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.|English
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.|English
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.|English
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.|English
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.|English
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.|English
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.|English
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.|English
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.|English
This latter point is of particular importance.|English
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.|English
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.|English
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.|English
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.|English
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.|English
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.|English
This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.|English
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.|English
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.|English
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.|English
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.|English
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.|English
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.|English
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.|English
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.|English
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.|English
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.|English
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.|English
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.|English
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands. Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.|English
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.|English
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.|English
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.|English
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.|English
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.|English
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.|English
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.|English
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.|English
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention.|English
Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds.|English
This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.|English
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.|English
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.|English
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.|English
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.|English
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.|English
I would like to explain our thinking here.|English
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.|English
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.|English
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.|English
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.|English
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.|English
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.|English
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.|English
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.|English
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.|English
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".|English
I urge the House to support these changes.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.|English
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.|English
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.|English
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.|English
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.|English
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.|English
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.|English
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.|English
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.|English
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.|English
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.|English
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.|English
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.|English
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.|English
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.|English
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.|English
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.|English
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.|English
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.|English
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.|English
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.|English
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.|English
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?|English
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.|English
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.|English
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.|English
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.|English
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.|English
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.|English
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.|English
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.|English
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.|English
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.|English
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.|English
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.|English
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.|English
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union|English
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].|English
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.|English
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.|English
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.|English
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.|English
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.|English
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.|English
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.|English
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.|English
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.|English
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.|English
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.|English
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.|English
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.|English
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.|English
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.|English
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.|English
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.|English
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.|English
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.|English
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.|English
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?|English
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?|English
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.|English
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.|English
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.|English
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.|English
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.|English
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.|English
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.|English
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.|English
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.|English
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.|English
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.|English
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.|English
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.|English
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.|English
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.|English
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.|English
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.|English
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.|English
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.|English
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.|English
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.|English
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.|English
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.|English
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.|English
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.|English
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.|English
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.|English
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.|English
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.|English
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.|English
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.|English
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.|English
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.|English
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.|English
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.|English
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.|English
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.|English
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.|English
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.|English
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.|English
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.|English
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.|English
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.|English
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.|English
What is the result?|English
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.|English
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.|English
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.|English
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.|English
We must give them this opportunity.|English
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.|English
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.|English
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.|English
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.|English
What is a fair society?|English
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.|English
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.|English
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.|English
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.|English
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.|English
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.|English
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.|English
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.|English
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.|English
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.|English
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.|English
So much for the quality.|English
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.|English
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.|English
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.|English
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.|English
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.|English
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.|English
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.|English
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.|English
I agree with your analysis.|English
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.|English
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.|English
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.|English
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.|English
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.|English
I should like to mention a few specific points.|English
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.|English
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.|English
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.|English
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.|English
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.|English
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.|English
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.|English
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.|English
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.|English
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.|English
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.|English
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.|English
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.|English
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.|English
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.|English
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.|English
This is my first point regarding the policy.|English
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.|English
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.|English
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.|English
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.|English
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.|English
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.|English
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.|English
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.|English
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.|English
Thank you very much, Commissioner.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)|English
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting|English
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.|English
Are there any comments?|English
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.|English
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.|English
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.|English
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.|English
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.|English
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.|English
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.|English
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.|English
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.|English
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.|English
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.|English
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.|English
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.|English
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.|English
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.|English
I understand what you are saying. We have taken note of this.|English
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.|English
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.|English
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.|English
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.|English
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.|English
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.|English
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.|English
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.|English
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.|English
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.|English
We will also pass this on to our services, however.|English
Thank you very much.|English
(The Minutes were approved)|English
Reform of European competition policy|English
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:|English
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];|English
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];|English
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);|English
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].|English
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.|English
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.|English
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .|English
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.|English
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.|English
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.|English
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.|English
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture.|English
As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.|English
It should continue along this path.|English
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.|English
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.|English
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.|English
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.|English
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.|English
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.|English
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?|English
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.|English
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.|English
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.|English
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.|English
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.|English
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.|English
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.|English
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.|English
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.|English
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.|English
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.|English
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.|English
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.|English
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.|English
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.|English
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.|English
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.|English
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.|English
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.|English
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.|English
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.|English
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.|English
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.|English
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.|English
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.|English
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.|English
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.|English
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.|English
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.|English
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.|English
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.|English
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.|English
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.|English
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.|English
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.|English
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.|English
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.|English
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.|English
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.|English
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.|English
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.|English
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.|English
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.|English
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.|English
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.|English
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.|English
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.|English
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.|English
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.|English
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle.|English
Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.|English
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.|English
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.|English
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.|English
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.|English
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.|English
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.|English
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.|English
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.|English
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.|English
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.|English
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.|English
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.|English
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.|English
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.|English
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.|English
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.|English
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.|English
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.|English
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.|English
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.|English
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.|English
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.|English
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.|English
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.|English
All this is to the good of the consumer.|English
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.|English
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.|English
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.|English
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.|English
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.|English
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.|English
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.|English
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.|English
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.|English
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.|English
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.|English
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.|English
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.|English
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.|English
One is subsidiarity.|English
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.|English
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.|English
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.|English
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.|English
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.|English
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.|English
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.|English
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.|English
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.|English
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.|English
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.|English
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.|English
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.|English
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.|English
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.|English
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.|English
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.|English
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.|English
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.|English
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.|English
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.|English
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.|English
In order to function, the market needs rules.|English
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.|English
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.|English
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.|English
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.|English
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.|English
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.|English
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.|English
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.|English
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.|English
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.|English
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.|English
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.|English
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.|English
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.|English
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.|English
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.|English
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.|English
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.|English
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.|English
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.|English
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.|English
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.|English
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.|English
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.|English
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.|English
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.|English
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.|English
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.|English
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.|English
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.|English
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?|English
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.|English
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.|English
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.|English
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.|English
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.|English
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.|English
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.|English
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.|English
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.|English
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.|English
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.|English
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?|English
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.|English
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.|English
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.|English
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.|English
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.|English
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.|English
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.|English
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.|English
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.|English
Should we not be discussing this issue?|English
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.|English
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.|English
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.|English
When will we debate that?|English
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.|English
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.|English
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.|English
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.|English
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.|English
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.|English
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.|English
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.|English
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.|English
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.|English
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.|English
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.|English
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.|English
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.|English
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.|English
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.|English
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.|English
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.|English
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.|English
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.|English
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.|English
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.|English
Mr President, we are holding a special debate: on competition policy and state aid, the government' s right and left hand, so to speak.|English
Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure, the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place.|English
This is understandable, because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave, with adverse effects on employment.|English
But, at the same time, this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money.|English
In principle, only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort, or hardly distort, competition.|English
The rapporteur' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7, therefore, deserve our support.|English
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society.|English
Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit.|English
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies.|English
If this comes to nothing, then the government has to step in.|English
The Commission' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper.|English
The plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the Directorate-General on Competition is a kind gesture, but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stretched.|English
This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry.|English
Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission?|English
What is the Council' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points?|English
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.|English
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.|English
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.|English
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.|English
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.|English
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.|English
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.|English
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.|English
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.|English
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.|English
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.|English
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.|English
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.|English
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.|English
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.|English
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?|English
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.|English
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.|English
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.|English
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.|English
They are still in training, as it were.|English
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?|English
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.|English
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.|English
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?|English
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.|English
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.|English
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.|English
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.|English
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.|English
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion.|English
For this reason, modernisation was essential.|English
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons.|English
Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.|English
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.|English
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.|English
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.|English
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.|English
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).|English
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).|English
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.|English
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.|English
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.|English
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.|English
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.|English
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.|English
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.|English
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.|English
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.|English
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.|English
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.|English
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.|English
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.|English
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.|English
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.|English
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.|English
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.|English
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.|English
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.|English
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?|English
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.|English
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.|English
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.|English
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.|English
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.|English
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.|English
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.|English
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.|English
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.|English
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.|English
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.|English
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.|English
This is why I give this report my full support.|English
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.|English
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.|English
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.|English
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.|English
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.|English
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.|English
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.|English
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.|English
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.|English
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.|English
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.|English
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination.|English
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.|English
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!|English
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.|English
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.|English
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.|English
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.|English
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.|English
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.|English
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.|English
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.|English
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.|English
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.|English
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.|English
So, judicially, something needs to be done.|English
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.|English
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.|English
It is important that business has legal certainty.|English
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.|English
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.|English
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.|English
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.|English
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.|English
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.|English
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.|English
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.|English
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.|English
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.|English
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.|English
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.|English
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.|English
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.|English
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.|English
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.|English
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.|English
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.|English
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.|English
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.|English
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.|English
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.|English
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.|English
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.|English
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.|English
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.|English
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.|English
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.|English
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.|English
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.|English
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.|English
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.|English
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.|English
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.|English
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.|English
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.|English
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.|English
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.|English
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.|English
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.|English
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.|English
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.|English
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.|English
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.|English
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.|English
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.|English
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.|English
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.|English
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.|English
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.|English
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.|English
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.|English
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.|English
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.|English
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.|English
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.|English
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.|English
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.|English
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.|English
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland.|English
Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."|English
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.|English
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.|English
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus.|English
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.|English
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.|English
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.|English
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.|English
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.|English
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.|English
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.|English
But opinion differs as to the solution.|English
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.|English
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.|English
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.|English
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.|English
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.|English
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.|English
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.|English
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.|English
This is unacceptable to my mind.|English
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.|English
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.|English
This is unacceptable in my view.|English
It would weaken a key element of European policy.|English
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.|English
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.|English
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.|English
There was no majority for this at the time.|English
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.|English
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.|English
I consider this to be unacceptable.|English
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.|English
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.|English
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.|English
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.|English
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.|English
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.|English
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.|English
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.|English
I agree with this request.|English
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.|English
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.|English
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.|English
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.|English
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.|English
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.|English
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.|English
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.|English
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.|English
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.|English
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.|English
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.|English
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.|English
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.|English
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.|English
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.|English
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.|English
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.|English
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.|English
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.|English
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement|English
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.|English
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.|English
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.|English
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.|English
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.|English
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.|English
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.|English
With what aim?|English
Not to save jobs.|English
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.|English
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.|English
Did these firms need state aid to survive?|English
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.|English
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.|English
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.|English
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.|English
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.|English
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.|English
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.|English
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.|English
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.|English
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.|English
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.|English
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.|English
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.|English
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.|English
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.|English
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.|English
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.|English
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.|English
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.|English
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.|English
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.|English
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.|English
The form the aid takes is important.|English
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.|English
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.|English
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.|English
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.|English
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.|English
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.|English
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.|English
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.|English
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.|English
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.|English
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.|English
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.|English
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.|English
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.|English
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.|English
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.|English
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.|English
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.|English
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.|English
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.|English
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.|English
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.|English
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.|English
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.|English
But Europe is changing.|English
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.|English
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.|English
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.|English
This is not in question.|English
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.|English
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?|English
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.|English
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.|English
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.|English
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market.|English
This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.|English
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.|English
Uniformity needs to be worked on.|English
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.|English
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.|English
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.|English
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?|English
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.|English
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.|English
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.|English
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.|English
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.|English
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat.|English
But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.|English
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.|English
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.|English
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.|English
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.|English
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.|English
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.|English
We all agree on this.|English
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.|English
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.|English
There have only been nine rejections.|English
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.|English
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!|English
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.|English
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.|English
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.|English
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.|English
Here improvements should be made.|English
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.|English
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.|English
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.|English
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.|English
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.|English
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.|English
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.|English
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.|English
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.|English
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.|English
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.|English
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.|English
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.|English
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.|English
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.|English
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.|English
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.|English
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.|English
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.|English
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.|English
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.|English
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.|English
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.|English
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.|English
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.|English
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.|English
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.|English
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.|English
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.|English
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.|English
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.|English
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.|English
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.|English
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.|English
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.|English
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.|English
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.|English
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.|English
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.|English
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.|English
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.|English
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance.|English
This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.|English
Many speakers have underlined this.|English
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.|English
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.|English
Why?|English
Is this simply a political gesture?|English
No.|English
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.|English
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.|English
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).|English
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.|English
The fourth group is legal certainty.|English
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.|English
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.|English
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.|English
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.|English
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.|English
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.|English
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.|English
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.|English
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.|English
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.|English
The first is greater transparency.|English
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.|English
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.|English
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.|English
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.|English
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.|English
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .|English
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.|English
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.|English
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.|English
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.|English
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.|English
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.|English
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.|English
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.|English
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.|English
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.|English
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.|English
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.|English
I am especially grateful for all of this. We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.|English
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.|English
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.|English
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.|English
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.|English
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.|English
The joint debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests|English
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.|English
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.|English
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.|English
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.|English
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.|English
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.|English
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.|English
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.|English
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.|English
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.|English
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.|English
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.|English
After five years only four have done so.|English
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.|English
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.|English
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.|English
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.|English
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.|English
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.|English
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.|English
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.|English
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.|English
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.|English
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.|English
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.|English
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.|English
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.|English
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.|English
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.|English
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.|English
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.|English
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.|English
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.|English
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).|English
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.|English
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.|English
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.|English
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.|English
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.|English
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.|English
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.|English
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.|English
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.|English
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement.|English
It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.|English
We need to do something about it.|English
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.|English
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.|English
We need to take this responsibility seriously.|English
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.|English
The question is: who prosecutes?|English
That is where we really get into difficulty.|English
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?|English
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.|English
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.|English
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.|English
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.|English
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.|English
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.|English
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.|English
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.|English
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.|English
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.|English
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.|English
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.|English
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.|English
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.|English
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.|English
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.|English
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.|English
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.|English
But the Member States failed to cooperate.|English
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.|English
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.|English
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.|English
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.|English
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.|English
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.|English
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.|English
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.|English
I would like to make one general point on politics.|English
Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.|English
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.|English
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.|English
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.|English
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.|English
Yet, every year we have the same problem.|English
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud. So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.|English
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.|English
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.|English
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.|English
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.|English
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.|English
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.|English
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.|English
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.|English
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.|English
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.|English
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.|English
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.|English
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.|English
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.|English
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.|English
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.|English
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.|English
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.|English
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.|English
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.|English
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.|English
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.|English
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.|English
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?|English
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.|English
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.|English
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.|English
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.|English
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.|English
It is fine, in principle.|English
It need only be fine-tuned.|English
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.|English
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.|English
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.|English
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.|English
And indeed there is a twofold shift.|English
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.|English
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.|English
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.|English
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.|English
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.|English
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.|English
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.|English
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.|English
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.|English
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.|English
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.|English
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.|English
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.|English
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.|English
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.|English
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?|English
I do not believe so.|English
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.|English
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.|English
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.|English
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.|English
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.|English
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.|English
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.|English
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.|English
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law.|English
Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.|English
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.|English
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.|English
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.|English
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!|English
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.|English
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?|English
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.|English
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.|English
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.|English
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.|English
So a great deal has to be done in this area.|English
And what exactly should be done?|English
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.|English
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.|English
So, unification in this small area.|English
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.|English
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.|English
It is, in fact, something very positive. Just like Europol.|English
Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.|English
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.|English
Parliament supports this.|English
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.|English
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.|English
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.|English
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.|English
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.|English
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.|English
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.|English
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.|English
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.|English
We need a public debate on this.|English
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.|English
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.|English
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.|English
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.|English
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.|English
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.|English
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.|English
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.|English
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.|English
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.|English
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.|English
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.|English
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.|English
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.|English
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.|English
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.|English
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?|English
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.|English
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.|English
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.|English
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.|English
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.|English
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.|English
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.|English
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.|English
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.|English
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.|English
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.|English
Nothing has changed there.|English
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.|English
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.|English
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.|English
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.|English
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.|English
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.|English
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.|English
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.|English
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.|English
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.|English
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.|English
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?|English
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?|English
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?|English
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.|English
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.|English
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.|English
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.|English
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.|English
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.|English
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.|English
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.|English
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.|English
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.|English
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.|English
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.|English
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.|English
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.|English
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.|English
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.|English
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.|English
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.|English
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.|English
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.|English
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.|English
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.|English
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.|English
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.|English
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.|English
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation|English
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.|English
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.|English
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.|English
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.|English
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.|English
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.|English
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.|English
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.|English
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.|English
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.|English
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.|English
VOTE|English
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)|English
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).|English
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4).|English
These are both about voting.|English
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?|English
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.|English
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.|English
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.|English
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.|English
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.|English
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.|English
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?|English
I shall, I assure you, Mr Heaton-Harris, pay particular attention to the show of hands.|English
I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote.|English

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources|English
(FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.|English
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.|English
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.|English
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.|English
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.|English
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.|English
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.|English
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.|English
There is as yet no federal European tax.|English
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.|English
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)|English
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.|English
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.|English
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.|English
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.|English
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.|English
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.|English
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.|English
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.|English
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.|English
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.|English
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.|English
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.|English
Parliament voted in favour of this text.|English
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .|English
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.|English
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.|English
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)|English
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.|English
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.|English
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.|English
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.|English
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.|English
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.|English
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.|English
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.|English
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!|English
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.|English
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.|English
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.|English
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.|English
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.|English
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.|English
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.|English
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)|English
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.|English
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.|English
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.|English
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.|English
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.|English
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.|English
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.|English
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.|English
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.|English
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.|English
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.|English
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.|English
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.|English
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.|English
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.|English
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.|English
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.|English
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.|English
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.|English
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.|English
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.|English
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.|English
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.|English
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.|English
In the meantime, let us support this first step.|English
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.|English
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.|English
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.|English
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.|English
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.|English
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.|English
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.|English
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.|English
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.|English
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.|English
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.|English
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.|English
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.|English
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.|English
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.|English
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.|English
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.|English
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.|English
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.|English
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.|English
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.|English
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.|English
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.|English
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.|English
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.|English
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.|English
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.|English
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.|English
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.|English
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.|English
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.|English
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.|English
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.|English
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.|English
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.|English
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.|English
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".|English
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.|English
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.|English
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)|English
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.|English
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.|English
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.|English
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.|English
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.|English
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.|English
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.|English
(FR) The Berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union.|English
Nonetheless, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein.|English
Paragraph 26, for example, "Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union" .|English
At a time when, in order to fulfil the convergence criteria, Member States are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime, one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative, the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony.|English
As an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU, the lack of results is put down to the lack of money, with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent.|English
What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations, rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects?|English
Expenditure becomes an end in itself, evidence of the success of a programme.|English
The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show, as Mr Berend pointed out, the limitations of the policy being implemented:|English
The relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the European Union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996, testifying to a concentration of wealth, jobs and activity in certain areas: Hamburg, Brussels, Antwerp, Luxembourg, the Paris region, Darmstadt, Oberbayern, Bremen, Vienna, Karlsruhe and Emilia-Romagna.|English
Quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated, the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate the exodus of population from the most outlying, the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central axes of the Union (the Benelux countries, North West Germany, Northern Italy, the Parisian region, etc).|English
The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment.|English
In 1986, the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41% of the overall Community GNP.|English
In 1996 it was 50%.|English
Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland.|English
In fact, if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor, then it seems that the middle-range regions, covered by Objective 2, are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their GNP, and a worsening of the employment situation.|English
This phenomenon is particularly marked in France: the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region, which it is my honour to represent, has gone from 105% to 94% of the Community average, that of the Loire region has dropped from 95% to 91%, and that of the Auvergne from 89% to 83%.|English
This is a generalised tendency, sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes, nor Alsace.|English
It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland, countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years, as in many regions of the United Kingdom.|English
It may therefore seem strange that, when the Structural Funds were reformed, Objective 2, dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed in favour of Objectives 1 and 3. For the period 1999-2006, the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion, a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999.|English
The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France, 27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region, Alsace or Lower Normandy, political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government.|English
Based as it is on such choices, it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union.|English
von Wogau Report (A5-0069/1999)|English
(FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.|English
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.|English
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.|English
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.|English
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.|English
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.|English
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.|English
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.|English
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.|English
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.|English
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.|English
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.|English
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.|English
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.|English
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.|English
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.|English
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.|English
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.|English
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.|English
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.|English
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?|English
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.|English
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.|English
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.|English
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.|English
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)|English
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.|English
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.|English
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.|English
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.|English
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.|English
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.|English
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.|English
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!|English
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.|English
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.|English
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.|English
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.|English
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.|English
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?|English
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.|English
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?|English
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?|English
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.|English
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)|English
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.|English
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.|English
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.|English
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.|English
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).|English
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.|English
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.|English
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).|English
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.|English
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.|English
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.|English
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.|English
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.|English
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.|English
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.|English
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.|English
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.|English
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)|English
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.|English
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.|English
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.|English
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.|English
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.|English
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.|English
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.|English
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.|English
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.|English
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.|English
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.|English
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.|English
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.|English
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.|English
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.|English
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)|English
Oil slick off the French coast|English
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.|English
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.|English
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.|English
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.|English
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.|English
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.|English
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?|English
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.|English
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.|English
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.|English
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.|English
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.|English
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.|English
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.|English
What are the conditions for this recognition?|English
What guarantees are there of its reliability?|English
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.|English
We await the outcome with great interest.|English
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.|English
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.|English
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.|English
Why not?|English
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?|English
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.|English
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.|English
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.|English
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.|English
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.|English
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.|English
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.|English
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.|English
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?|English
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?|English
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?|English
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.|English
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.|English
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.|English
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods.|English
Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.|English
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.|English
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.|English
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.|English
The time for resolutions has passed.|English
What is now needed is action.|English
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.|English
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.|English
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.|English
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.|English
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.|English
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.|English
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.|English
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.|English
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.|English
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?|English
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.|English
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.|English
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.|English
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"|English
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.|English
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"|English
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.|English
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.|English
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.|English
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.|English
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.|English
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.|English
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?|English
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.|English
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.|English
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.|English
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?|English
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.|English
I can testify to this remarkable work.|English
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.|English
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.|English
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.|English
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.|English
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.|English
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.|English
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.|English
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.|English
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.|English
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.|English
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.|English
This is no longer tolerable.|English
Next, we have flags of convenience.|English
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.|English
This is no longer tolerable.|English
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.|English
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.|English
This is no longer tolerable.|English
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.|English
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.|English
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.|English
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.|English
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.|English
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.|English
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.|English
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.|English
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.|English
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.|English
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.|English
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.|English
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.|English
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.|English
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.|English
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.|English
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.|English
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.|English
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.|English
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.|English
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.|English
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.|English
This must be brought forward.|English
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.|English
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.|English
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.|English
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.|English
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.|English
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.|English
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.|English
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.|English
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.|English
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.|English
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.|English
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.|English
And now the Erika.|English
Whose turn is next?|English
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.|English
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.|English
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.|English
And this is the result.|English
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.|English
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.|English
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.|English
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.|English
What we have here is an ecological disaster.|English
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.|English
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.|English
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.|English
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.|English
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?|English
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.|English
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.|English
We know what actually happened.|English
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.|English
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.|English
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.|English
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.|English
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.|English
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.|English
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.|English
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.|English
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.|English
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.|English
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.|English
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.|English
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.|English
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.|English
Many thanks for this.|English
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.|English
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.|English
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.|English
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.|English
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.|English
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.|English
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?|English
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.|English
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place.|English
So this 25% should be increased. Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.|English
But this is not in place.|English
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.|English
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.|English
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.|English
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.|English
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.|English
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.|English
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .|English
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.|English
So what are we to do now?|English
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.|English
What are we to do now?|English
I will tell you a few things we should do.|English
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.|English
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.|English
So what do we need to happen immediately?|English
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.|English
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.|English
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.|English
This is what we need for ships.|English
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.|English
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.|English
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.|English
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.|English
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.|English
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.|English
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!|English
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.|English
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.|English
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.|English
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.|English
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.|English
The unions will have something to say as will industry.|English
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.|English
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.|English
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .|English
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.|English
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."|English
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!|English
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.|English
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.|English
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?|English
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.|English
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?|English
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.|English
We must also critically examine the classification societies.|English
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.|English
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.|English
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.|English
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.|English
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.|English
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.|English
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.|English
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?|English
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?|English
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.|English
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.|English
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.|English
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.|English
However, we must stick to the facts.|English
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.|English
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.|English
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.|English
I cannot accept this.|English
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.|English
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.|English
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.|English
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.|English
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.|English
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.|English
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.|English
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.|English
There are reputable companies too.|English
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.|English
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!|English
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.|English
It could have sunk anywhere.|English
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.|English
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.|English
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.|English
By now they are far away.|English
It is a miracle that they were saved.|English
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.|English
Things could well continue in the same way.|English
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.|English
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.|English
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.|English
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.|English
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?|English
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.|English
We would like to know their names and their faces.|English
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.|English
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.|English
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.|English
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.|English
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.|English
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.|English
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million. This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.|English
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.|English
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.|English
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.|English
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.|English
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.|English
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.|English
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.|English
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.|English
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.|English
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.|English
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.|English
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.|English
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.|English
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.|English
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.|English
On the other hand, prevention is essential.|English
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.|English
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.|English
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.|English
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.|English
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.|English
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.|English
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:|English
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.|English
That should be the starting point for our efforts.|English
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.|English
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.|English
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.|English
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.|English
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.|English
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.|English
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.|English
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.|English
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.|English
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.|English
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.|English
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.|English
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.|English
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.|English
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.|English
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.|English
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.|English
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.|English
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.|English
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.|English
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.|English
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.|English
In this area we must respond to public opinion.|English
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.|English
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.|English
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.|English
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.|English
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.|English
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.|English
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.|English
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.|English
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.|English
States can carry out port inspections.|English
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.|English
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.|English
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.|English
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.|English
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.|English
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?|English
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?|English
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?|English
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.|English
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.|English
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.|English
There are four more sister ships in service at present.|English
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.|English
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.|English
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?|English
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?|English
RINA is currently the talk of the town.|English
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.|English
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.|English
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.|English
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.|English
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.|English
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.|English
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?|English
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.|English
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.|English
(The President cut the speaker off)|English
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.|English
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.|English
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.|English
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.|English
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.|English
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.|English
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.|English
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.|English
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.|English
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.|English
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.|English
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.|English
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.|English
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.|English
The victims are waiting outside.|English
They want answers.|English
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.|English
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"|English
Who will provide us with new jobs?|English
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.|English
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.|English
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .|English
But there is an art to that as well.|English
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.|English
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.|English
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.|English
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.|English
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.|English
The issue is as topical as it was before.|English
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.|English
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.|English
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.|English
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem. There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas.|English
They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium. And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.|English
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.|English
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.|English
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.|English
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.|English
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.|English
That is the reality.|English
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.|English
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.|English
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.|English
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.|English
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.|English
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.|English
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.|English
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.|English
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.|English
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.|English
We already have legislation.|English
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.|English
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.|English
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.|English
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.|English
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.|English
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.|English
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability.|English
Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.|English
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.|English
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.|English
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.|English
I will end now. I will not expand further.|English
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.|English
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.|English
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.|English
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.|English
Thank you very much, Commissioner.|English
We have taken good note of your intentions.|English
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.|English
Storms in Europe|English
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.|English
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.|English
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.|English
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.|English
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.|English
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.|English
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.|English
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.|English
Let me explain.|English
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.|English
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.|English
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.|English
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.|English
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.|English
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.|English
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.|English
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.|English
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.|English
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.|English
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.|English
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.|English
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.|English
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.|English
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.|English
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?|English
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.|English
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.|English
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.|English
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.|English
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.|English
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.|English
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.|English
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.|English
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.|English
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.|English
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.|English
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.|English
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.|English
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.|English
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.|English
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.|English
I can show you a copy if you wish.|English
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.|English
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.|English
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.|English
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.|English
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.|English
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.|English
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.|English
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.|English
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.|English
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.|English
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.|English
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.|English
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.|English
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.|English
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.|English
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.|English
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.|English
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.|English
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.|English
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.|English
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.|English
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.|English
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.|English
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.|English
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.|English
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.|English
Current programmes must be accelerated.|English
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.|English
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.|English
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.|English
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.|English
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!|English
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto. However, it has now achieved notoriety.|English
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.|English
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.|English
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.|English
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.|English
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.|English
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?|English
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.|English
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.|English
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.|English
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.|English
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.|English
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.|English
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.|English
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.|English
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.|English
This is wrong! And no one can comprehend this attitude.|English
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.|English
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.|English
I say they have a right to solidarity.|English
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.|English
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.|English
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.|English
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.|English
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.|English
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.|English
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.|English
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.|English
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.|English
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.|English
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.|English
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!|English
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.|English
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.|English
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.|English
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.|English
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.|English
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.|English
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.|English
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.|English
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.|English
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.|English
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.|English
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.|English
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.|English
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream. But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.|English
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.|English
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.|English
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.|English
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.|English
This is an irreparable loss.|English
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.|English
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.|English
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.|English
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.|English
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.|English
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.|English
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.|English
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.|English
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.|English
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.|English
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.|English
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.|English
That is important.|English
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.|English
It was very small.|English
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.|English
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.|English
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.|English
I think we should reinstate this budget line.|English
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.|English
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.|English
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.|English
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.|English
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.|English
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.|English
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.|English
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.|English
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.|English
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.|English
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.|English
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.|English
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.|English
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.|English
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.|English
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.|English
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.|English
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.|English
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.|English
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.|English
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.|English
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.|English
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.|English
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.|English
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.|English
The calculations are in decades rather than years.|English
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.|English
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....|English
(The President cut the speaker off)|English
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.|English
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.|English
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.|English
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.|English
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.|English
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.|English
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.|English
Natural habitats were destroyed.|English
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.|English
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.|English
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.|English
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.|English
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.|English
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.|English
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.|English
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.|English
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.|English
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.|English
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!|English
Food safety|English
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.|English
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.|English
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.|English
That is very much the right approach.|English
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.|English
I hope that we can thrash this out.|English
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.|English
It is very important that we include liability in that process.|English
That is the one word I am talking about.|English
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.|English
That cannot continue.|English
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.|English
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.|English
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.|English
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.|English
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?|English
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?|English
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?|English
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.|English
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.|English
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.|English
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.|English
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.|English
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?|English
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?|English
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.|English
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?|English
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.|English
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.|English
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.|English
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.|English
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.|English
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.|English
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.|English
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.|English
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.|English
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.|English
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.|English
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.|English
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.|English
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.|English
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.|English
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.|English
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.|English
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.|English
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.|English
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.|English
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.|English
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.|English
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.|English
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.|English
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.|English
I also welcome the White Paper.|English
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?|English
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.|English
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?|English
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.|English
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.|English
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.|English
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.|English
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?|English
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.|English
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.|English
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.|English
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.|English
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.|English
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.|English
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.|English
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.|English
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.|English
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.|English
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.|English
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.|English
There may be a number of views on that.|English
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.|English
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.|English
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.|English
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.|English
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.|English
It must be visible.|English
It must be known.|English
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.|English
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.|English
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.|English
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.|English
It must be visible.|English
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.|English
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.|English
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.|English
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.|English
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.|English
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.|English
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.|English
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.|English
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.|English
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.|English
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.|English
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence.|English
It is something that is earned over a period of time.|English
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.|English
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.|English
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.|English
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.|English
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.|English
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.|English
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.|English
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.|English
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.|English
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.|English
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!|English
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.|English
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.|English
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.|English
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.|English
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.|English
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.|English
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.|English
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.|English
That is my judgement at the moment.|English
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.|English
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.|English
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.|English
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.|English
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.|English
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.|English
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.|English
That concludes the debate.|English
Question Time (Commission)|English
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000).|English
We will examine questions to the Commission.|English
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.|English
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.|English
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.|English
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.|English
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.|English
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.|English
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.|English
First Part|English
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):|English
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.|English
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.|English
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?|English
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.|English
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.|English
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.|English
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.|English
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.|English
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.|English
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.|English
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.|English
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.|English
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.|English
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.|English
Thank you for your reply.|English
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.|English
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.|English
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.|English
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.|English
So much for the political aspect.|English
Now to the technical aspect.|English
The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.|English
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.|English
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.|English
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.|English
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.|English
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.|English
I have explained the position of the Commission.|English
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.|English
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.|English
In the case of Turkey it is different.|English
The plant is not yet there.|English
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.|English
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.|English
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.|English
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?|English
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.|English
I do not have these concerns.|English
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.|English
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):|English
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?|English
If not, why not?|English
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.|English
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.|English
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.|English
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study.|English
It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.|English
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.|English
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.|English
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.|English
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.|English
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.|English
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.|English
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.|English
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.|English
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.|English
A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed. It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.|English
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.|English
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.|English
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.|English
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.|English
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.|English
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?|English
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?|English
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.|English
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.|English
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.|English
That is also mentioned in the report.|English
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.|English
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.|English
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.|English
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.|English
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.|English
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.|English
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.|English
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?|English
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.|English
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.|English
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.|English
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.|English
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution. That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.|English
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.|English
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?|English
I cannot answer that question.|English
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.|English
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.|English
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.|English
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):|English
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.|English
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.|English
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.|English
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.|English
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?|English
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.|English
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.|English
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.|English
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.|English
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.|English
I urge the Chinese again to do so.|English
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.|English
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.|English
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.|English
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.|English
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.|English
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.|English
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.|English
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.|English
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.|English
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.|English
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.|English
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.|English
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.|English
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.|English
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.|English
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.|English
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.|English
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.|English
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.|English
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.|English
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.|English
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.|English
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.|English
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.|English
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?|English
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.|English
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.|English
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.|English
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.|English
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.|English
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.|English
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.|English
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.|English
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.|English
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):|English
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.|English
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.|English
Are these reports accurate?|English
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?|English
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?|English
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.|English
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.|English
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.|English
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.|English
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.|English
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.|English
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.|English
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.|English
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.|English
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.|English
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.|English
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.|English
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner. However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.|English
The newspaper reports were misleading.|English
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.|English
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.|English
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.|English
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.|English
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.|English
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.|English
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?|English
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true!|English
"I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".|English
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.|English
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.|English
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.|English
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.|English
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.|English
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.|English
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.|English
I wish you a good evening.|English
Second Part|English
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten|English
Questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Nielson.|English
Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa.|English
I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions.|English
Question No 33 by (H-0829/99):|English
Subject: 'Mainstreaming' in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ('mainstreaming') into the full range of EU aid policy.|English
The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in 'gender mainstreaming' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate-General for Development.|English
'Mainstreaming' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy, strategy and measures.|English
To achieve that, the Council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety.|English
Current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days' training in such issues should form an essential part of the Directorate-General for Development's introductory courses for new staff.|English
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures?|English
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.|English
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.|English
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.|English
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.|English
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.|English
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.|English
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.|English
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.|English
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .|English
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.|English
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.|English
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.|English
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.|English
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.|English
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.|English
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.|English
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.|English
That is naturally unacceptable.|English
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?|English
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.|English
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.|English
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.|English
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?|English
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.|English
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.|English
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential.|English
And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.|English
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.|English
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.|English
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.|English
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.|English
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.|English
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.|English
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.|English
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.|English
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.|English
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.|English
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.|English
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.|English
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.|English
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.|English
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.|English
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.|English
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.|English
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.|English
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular.|English
That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.|English
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.|English
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.|English
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.|English
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.|English
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.|English
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.|English
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.|English
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.|English
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.|English
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.|English
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.|English
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.|English
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.|English
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.|English
This is not the usual state of affairs.|English
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.|English
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.|English
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):|English
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.|English
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.|English
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.|English
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are?|English
Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?|English
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.|English
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.|English
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .|English
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.|English
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.|English
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.|English
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.|English
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.|English
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.|English
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.|English
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.|English
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?|English
Did anyone find work? How many people found work?|English
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.|English
What has been done about training?|English
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?|English
Do we have any figures?|English
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?|English
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.|English
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.|English
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.|English
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.|English
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.|English
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.|English
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):|English
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?|English
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.|English
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.|English
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.|English
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.|English
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.|English
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.|English
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.|English
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.|English
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.|English
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.|English
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.|English
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.|English
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.|English
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.|English
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.|English
I think that the answer is brief and clear.|English
Of course it is as you say.|English
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.|English
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.|English
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):|English
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?|English
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.|English
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.|English
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.|English
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.|English
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.|English
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.|English
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):|English
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).|English
Which Commissioners are members of this group?|English
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?|English
What concrete measures have been discussed?|English
This question covers several individual matters.|English
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.|English
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.|English
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.|English
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.|English
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance. We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.|English
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.|English
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.|English
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...|English
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.|English
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):|English
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.|English
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.|English
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?|English
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?|English
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?|English
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.|English
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.|English
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.|English
This is an important aspect of this initiative.|English
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.|English
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.|English
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.|English
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.|English
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.|English
The last question concerns the amount granted.|English
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.|English
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.|English
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.|English
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.|English
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas.|English
However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.|English
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.|English
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.|English
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.|English
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.|English
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission.|English
To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.|English
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.|English
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.|English
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):|English
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).|English
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?|English
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.|English
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.|English
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.|English
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.|English
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.|English
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.|English
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.|English
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.|English
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.|English
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.|English
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.|English
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.|English
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.|English
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.|English
In other words, it is positive discrimination.|English
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.|English
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.|English
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):|English
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?|English
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?|English
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.|English
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.|English
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.|English
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.|English
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.|English
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.|English
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.|English
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.|English
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.|English
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.|English
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.|English
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.|English
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.|English
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.|English
The Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s intervention.|English
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):|English
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.|English
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?|English
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.|English
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.|English
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.|English
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.|English
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.|English
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.|English
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.|English
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?|English
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.|English
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.|English
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.|English
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.|English
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.|English
Since the author is not present, Question No 43 lapses.|English
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):|English
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.|English
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.|English
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?|English
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.|English
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.|English
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.|English
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.|English
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.|English
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.|English
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.|English
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.|English
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.|English
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.|English
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.|English
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.|English
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.|English
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.|English
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.|English
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.|English
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.|English
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):|English
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.|English
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.|English
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.|English
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.|English
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.|English
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?|English
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?|English
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.|English
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.|English
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.|English
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.|English
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.|English
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.|English
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.|English
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.|English
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.|English
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.|English
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.|English
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.|English
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark.|English
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.|English
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.|English
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.|English
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.|English
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.|English
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.|English
We congratulate you.|English
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.|English
That concludes Question Time.|English
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)|English
1997 discharge|English
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]|English
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.|English
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.|English
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.|English
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.|English
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.|English
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.|English
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.|English
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.|English
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.|English
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.|English
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.|English
This has now been done.|English
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.|English
This is in place too.|English
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.|English
It did this as well.|English
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.|English
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.|English
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.|English
We want more than that, however.|English
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.|English
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.|English
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.|English
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.|English
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.|English
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.|English
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.|English
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.|English
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.|English
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.|English
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.|English
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.|English
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.|English
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.|English
I would quote Gaza as an example.|English
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.|English
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.|English
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.|English
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.|English
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.|English
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.|English
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission.|English
But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.|English
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union.|English
The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.|English
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.|English
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.|English
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.|English
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.|English
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.|English
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.|English
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.|English
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.|English
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.|English
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.|English
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.|English
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.|English
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.|English
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.|English
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.|English
But we need that reform process.|English
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.|English
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.|English
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.|English
It groups them together and that is very important.|English
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.|English
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. We have to get this right.|English
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.|English
We have to remedy that.|English
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.|English
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.|English
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.|English
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.|English
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.|English
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.|English
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.|English
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.|English
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.|English
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.|English
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.|English
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.|English
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.|English
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.|English
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.|English
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.|English
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.|English
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.|English
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.|English
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.|English
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.|English
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.|English
The other issue is access to confidential documents.|English
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.|English
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.|English
We have put down an amendment to that effect.|English
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.|English
The situation there is totally unacceptable.|English
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.|English
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.|English
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.|English
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.|English
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.|English
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.|English
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.|English
It is about a Commission which is no more.|English
There is now a new Commission.|English
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?|English
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.|English
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.|English
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.|English
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.|English
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.|English
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.|English
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission.|English
They look good in themselves.|English
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.|English
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.|English
The previous speaker already said something about this.|English
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.|English
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.|English
This also applies to whistle-blowers.|English
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.|English
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.|English
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.|English
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.|English
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.|English
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.|English
Clear progress must be visible.|English
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.|English
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.|English
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.|English
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.|English
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.|English
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.|English
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.|English
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.|English
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.|English
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.|English
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.|English
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.|English
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.|English
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.|English
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.|English
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.|English
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.|English
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.|English
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.|English
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution. The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.|English
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.|English
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.|English
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.|English
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.|English
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.|English
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.|English
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.|English
That is just the way things are, however.|English
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.|English
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.|English
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.|English
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.|English
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.|English
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.|English
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.|English
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.|English
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.|English
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.|English
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.|English
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.|English
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.|English
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.|English
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.|English
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.|English
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.|English
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.|English
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit.|English
The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.|English
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.|English
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start.|English
I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.|English
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.|English
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.|English
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.|English
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.|English
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.|English
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.|English
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.|English
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents.|English
Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.|English
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts|English
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.|English
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.|English
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".|English
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.|English
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.|English
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.|English
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.|English
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.|English
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.|English
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.|English
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.|English
The number of departments has been reduced.|English
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.|English
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.|English
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.|English
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.|English
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.|English
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.|English
A new independent audit system service must be set up.|English
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.|English
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.|English
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.|English
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.|English
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.|English
Urgent change is required today.|English
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.|English
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.|English
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.|English
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.|English
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.|English
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.|English
A number of codes have since been introduced.|English
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.|English
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.|English
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.|English
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.|English
They must be implemented without delay.|English
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.|English
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.|English
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.|English
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.|English
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.|English
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.|English
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.|English
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.|English
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.|English
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.|English
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.|English
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.|English
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.|English
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.|English
This communication must contain a clear timetable.|English
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.|English
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.|English
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.|English
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.|English
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.|English
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.|English
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.|English
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.|English
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.|English
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.|English
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.|English
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.|English
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.|English
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.|English
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.|English
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.|English
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.|English
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.|English
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.|English
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.|English
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.|English
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.|English
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.|English
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.|English
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.|English
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.|English
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.|English
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.|English
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.|English
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.|English
Have the lessons not been learnt?|English
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.|English
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.|English
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.|English
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.|English
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.|English
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.|English
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.|English
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.|English
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.|English
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.|English
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.|English
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.|English
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.|English
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.|English
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.|English
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.|English
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.|English
It is an excellent report.|English
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.|English
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.|English
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.|English
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.|English
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.|English
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.|English
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.|English
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.|English
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.|English
That is important.|English
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.|English
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.|English
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.|English
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.|English
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.|English
I will give you one example of this.|English
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.|English
It is clear that is not acceptable.|English
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?|English
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.|English
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.|English
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.|English
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.|English
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.|English
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.|English
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.|English
Our own staff policy is outdated.|English
Some of our working practices need radical reform.|English
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.|English
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.|English
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.|English
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.|English
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.|English
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.|English
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.|English
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.|English
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.|English
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.|English
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.|English
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.|English
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.|English
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.|English
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.|English
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.|English
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.|English
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.|English
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report.|English
I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.|English
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.|English
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure. Is this possible?|English
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.|English
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.|English
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.|English
It is his first report here in plenary.|English
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.|English
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.|English
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.|English
Let us be honest.|English
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.|English
We are now four months down the line.|English
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.|English
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.|English
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.|English
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope. Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?|English
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.|English
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.|English
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.|English
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.|English
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.|English
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.|English
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.|English
I would like to end on the following point.|English
Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.|English
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.|English
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.|English
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.|English
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.|English
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.|English
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.|English
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.|English
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.|English
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.|English
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.|English
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.|English
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.|English
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.|English
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.|English
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.|English
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.|English
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.|English
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.|English
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.|English
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.|English
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.|English
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.|English
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.|English
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.|English
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.|English
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.|English
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.|English
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.|English
Allow me to start with the most important demand.|English
We do not want financial control to be abolished.|English
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.|English
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.|English
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.|English
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.|English
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.|English
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.|English
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.|English
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.|English
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.|English
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.|English
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.|English
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.|English
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.|English
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.|English
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.|English
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.|English
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent.|English
Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.|English
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.|English
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.|English
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.|English
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.|English
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.|English
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.|English
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.|English
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.|English
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.|English
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.|English
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.|English
This must be regulated during the IGC.|English
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.|English
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.|English
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.|English
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.|English
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.|English
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.|English
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.|English
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.|English
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.|English
It now appears that this desire is more serious.|English
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.|English
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.|English
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.|English
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.|English
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.|English
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.|English
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.|English
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.|English
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.|English
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.|English
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.|English
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.|English
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.|English
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.|English
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.|English
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.|English
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.|English
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.|English
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.|English
A single key is to suffice in future.|English
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.|English
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.|English
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.|English
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.|English
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.|English
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.|English
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.|English
However, the financial controllers must work independently.|English
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.|English
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.|English
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.|English
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.|English
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.|English
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?|English
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.|English
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.|English
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.|English
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.|English
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.|English
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.|English
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.|English
There is no backbone, and no teeth.|English
Where is the beef?|English
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.|English
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.|English
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!|English
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.|English
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.|English
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.|English
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.|English
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.|English
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.|English
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.|English
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.|English
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.|English
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.|English
This report is about the Commission.|English
Parliament is a separate subject.|English
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.|English
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.|English
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.|English
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.|English
Most of the report is about financial control.|English
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.|English
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.|English
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.|English
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.|English
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.|English
We should get it into perspective.|English
It is important to remember that.|English
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.|English
They have very little of it.|English
They have a much wider responsibility.|English
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.|English
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.|English
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.|English
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.|English
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.|English
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.|English
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.|English
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.|English
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.|English
Perhaps this is a little worrying.|English
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.|English
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one.|English
As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.|English
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.|English
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.|English
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.|English
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.|English
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.|English
These are what are missing.|English
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.|English
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.|English
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.|English
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.|English
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.|English
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.|English
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.|English
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.|English
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.|English
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.|English
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so.|English
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.|English
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.|English
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.|English
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.|English
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.|English
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.|English
A very important proposal indeed.|English
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.|English
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.|English
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.|English
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.|English
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.|English
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.|English
Finally, the issue of officials.|English
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.|English
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.|English
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised.|English
Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.|English
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.|English
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.|English
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.|English
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.|English
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.|English
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.|English
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.|English
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.|English
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.|English
'Long-winded' .|English
I am not going to mention the length of this report.|English
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.|English
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.|English
It is also 'confusing' .|English
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.|English
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.|English
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.|English
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.|English
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.|English
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.|English
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.|English
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.|English
Securing this is a major priority.|English
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.|English
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.|English
We must win back their faith in EU politics.|English
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.|English
This is what enables them to understand what is going on. They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served|English
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.|English
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.|English
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.|English
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.|English
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!|English
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.|English
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.|English
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.|English
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.|English
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.|English
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.|English
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.|English
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.|English
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.|English
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.|English
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.|English
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.|English
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.|English
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.|English
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.|English
Hence the transmission.|English
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.|English
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.|English
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.|English
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.|English
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.|English
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.|English
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.|English
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.|English
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.|English
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.|English
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.|English
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.|English
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.|English
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.|English
Change in the law is fundamental.|English
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.|English
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.|English
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.|English
That service will open on 1 May this year.|English
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.|English
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.|English
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.|English
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.|English
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.|English
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.|English
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".|English
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.|English
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.|English
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.|English
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.|English
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.|English
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month.|English
"The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.|English
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.|English
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."|English
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.|English
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.|English
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.|English
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.|English
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.|English
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.|English
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.|English
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.|English
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.|English
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.|English
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.|English
We are seeking to implement best practice.|English
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.|English
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.|English
A communication later this year will give full details.|English
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.|English
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.|English
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.|English
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.|English
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.|English
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.|English
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.|English
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life. That is in line with the draft resolution.|English
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.|English
I welcome Parliament's support for that.|English
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.|English
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.|English
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.|English
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.|English
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.|English
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.|English
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.|English
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.|English
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.|English
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.|English
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.|English
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.|English
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.|English
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.|English
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.|English
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.|English
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.|English
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.|English
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.|English
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.|English
That is most certainly relevant.|English
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.|English
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.|English
Parliament has frequently made that point.|English
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.|English
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.|English
They are already having implications for resource availability.|English
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.|English
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.|English
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.|English
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.|English
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.|English
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.|English
The debate is closed.|English
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.|English
It cannot be ruled out that certain habitats may have been permanently damaged, and the restoration of the environment is often a long drawn-out process.|English
