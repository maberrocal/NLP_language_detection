# NLP Language Detector

Language text detector in Python

With this code you will be able to detect the language of a text given as input.

The main file is **setup.py**. Here, you can set differents paths like:

    LANGDATA_FOLDER = 'corpus/txt' -> The sources files to generate the profiles are located in this folder.

    LANGDATA_PROFILE = 'lang_profile' -> The generated profiles of the languages will be stored in this folder.
    
    TEST_PATH = "test/prueba.csv" -> This will be the file with the test sentences.
